# MM1_SOS_CATASTROPHE_QUEUE_RESEARCH_WORK
This repository contain the programming part which is used by me in generating numerical results in my research work and overview of my work as a part of my Btech Project and Mtech Thesis. 
## Abstract
This work deals with the transient and steady-state analysis of an infinite buffer single server Markovian
queueing system with optional service and catastrophes. Units enter the system following the Poisson manner
and receive a compulsory first essential service (FES). Upon completion of F ES, units can opt for a second
optional service (SOS) with a certain probability following the Bernoulli distribution. The single server offers
exponential service to one unit at a time for F ES and SOS. Catastrophes enter the busy system according to
the Poisson distribution, which either eliminates every unit in the system (i.e., in service or in the queue) or;
due to the system administrator’s security measures, all the units will likely survive according to the Bernoulli
distribution. The probability-generating function is obtained for the system length distribution for both transient
and steady states. Then, applying the Runge-Kutta method, the transient-state probabilities are approximated
numerically, whereas the closed-form expression for the steady-state solution is also obtained. Finally, several
metaheuristic optimization approaches are employed to optimize the system’s attributes in order to maximize its
overall profit, which involves protection parameter
